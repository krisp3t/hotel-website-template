# Hotel Website Template

A modern looking, minimalistic website template for a fictional hotel company built with pure HTML & CSS and lightweight JS.
Built upon **responsive design** — looks perfect on mobile, tablets & widescreens (1080p, 1440p, 4K).

Tested on Chrome / Edge 88, Firefox 85 and Safari 14.
